# shortest-path-navigation
Write a program that finds the shortest path between an initial state and the final state. The agent can move one square at a time in any of the four principal compass directions, and the program should find the shortest distance between the two points and then output a string of letters (L, R, D, and U for left, right, down, and up) indicating that solution.
